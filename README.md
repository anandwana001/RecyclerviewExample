# RecyclerView Example

This sample app is developed from the video tutorial by [codingwithmitch.com](codingwithmitch.com). Implementation of Recyclerview using Kotlin. 

I had also added the Dagger 2 (Dependency Injection) as a part of learning. Here, Dagger helps us to provide the adapter dependency to the Activity class from outside. 

Dagger has three important parts. 
1. Modules - dependency provider
2. Component - dependency manager
3. Class that required Dependency - dependency consumer

@modules, @component, @inject, @provides, @Scope, @Qualifier, @kotlin.annotation.Retention
